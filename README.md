This repo has one-off programs I developed for different projects.

To run each program, go to the folder:

- create virtual environment: `$virtualenv venv`
- activate virtual env: `$source venv/bin/activate`
- install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- read the Readme to run the program
