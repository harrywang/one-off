A small community, surrounded by water and parkland, so close to such a city!   The second reason I love my neighborhood is it's history. City Island used to be a oyster/fishing village (there are still places to rent boats and fishing equipment for those interested), and many inhabitants were boat builders ((website hidden)). City Island even has it's own Nautical Museum, if you need a weekend afternoon activity.","I am going to put this in a few places (also above in the overall description) as this has been a little bit of an issue for past guests: If you are looking for a place from which to explore Manhattans night life, this is probably not the place for you. The public bus that runs from the end of the 6 train onto City Island stops running a little before midnight.  However, if you only want to do day trips, explore the Bronx (or Queens), and come back to a quiet house with no traffic sounds, this is the perfect location.","The easiest way to get to Manhattan quickly is to drive to the Hunts Point station on the 6 train (this gets you to midtown in a little under an hour). If driving isn't your thing, there is a public bus (the Bx29) that runs from City Island to the Pelham Bay station (the last station on the 6 line in the Bronx), this option will take you a little less than an hour and a half to get to midtown manhattan. Fare is now $2.75 per ride, and comes with a free transfer. Parking is available on the street in front of the property (we do have a driveway in a pinch, but it's a little inconvenient).",The house is just a place to sleep (and cook and shower). We have a great big back yard (by city standards) with a picnic table for outdoor diners. There is also a garage space with weights and some boxing equipment for the exercise-inclined.,"I live in the back house (there are two houses on the property, my father lives in the front house) full time. The house is generally empty during weekdays, but the living room, kitchen and bathroom are shared spaces, so interaction will be inevitable. However, I'm pretty laid back. As long as you do your dishes! ;)","Only a few actual rules: 1. Don't smoke in the house. There is a beautiful back yard for that. 2. Strip the bed before you check out and leave the sheets in a pile on the bed so I can just grab them and throw them in the wash. 3. Take out the trash on our way out as you leave. The garbage is located to the left of the stair as you're exiting the front door. 4. Check to make sure ALL windows are closed before using the heat or ac. There are a lot, don't give up, this ends up in a LOT of wasted energy in an already energy-high house! Other than that, I'm a very reasonable person. I'll try to respect your space and clean up after myself while you're here, and I expect you to do the same. Nobody gets everything exactly right the first time and 2nd chances make the world go round, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our best. I love pets. Furry, scaly, feathery, doesn't matter. Pets are not only allowed, they're encouraged!

Both my parents are biologists, and it looks like it's contagious. My favorite mode of travel is my own two feet (sometimes with the help of a canoe). I have many passions, but two of them are learning about the natural world, and showing people how wonderful it is! I've lead canoe trips in northern Ontario, trail crews in Colorado and Virginia, and I'm always looking for the next adventure. 

I've been a part of  the Air BnB community since 2015, and I love meeting new people and exchanging stories. I keep my plate very full, so I do not cook for guests, and sometimes my house gets a little messy, but I make sure to keep common areas clear and clean for your use. I have refurbished the house mostly on my own (with help from friends and family for the heavy lifting of course), and I'm welcome to suggestions for updates!

I am a young professional in management and a native New Yorker. I love to travel and know the feeling of finding a comfortable, clean space in a nice neighborhood when I am away from home. When I travel I truly enjoy experiencing my destination like a local. I hope you get that feeling with my home! 

During my free time I enjoy running outdoors, exploring NYC, Painting, and going out on the town for Salsa Night! I like to have fun and take any opportunity I can to travel! Some of the places I've traveled to are Mexico, Canada, London, various countries in the Carribean, and many US cities (NOLA, Chicago, Dallas,Miami, Minneapolis to name a few).

I am fluent in Spanish and I love meeting people from all cultures.
Being From NYC, Pizza is one of my Favorite foods and I can gladly take you to my favorite pizza shop!
